This is a Sinatra application (http://sinatrarb.com/) that gathers statistics about the current environment, and returns a YAML file for those statistics.

All gathered statistics is hard-coded:

* load average (1, 5 and 15 minutes);
* disk space free / used on all partitions;
* number of web requests in the past 1/5/15 minutes;
* hits per domain for the past 1/5/15 minutes;
* bytes out for the past 1/5/15 minutes;
* request duration for the past 1/5/15 minutes;
* requests per second for the past 1/5/15 minutes.

No other data processing is done in this application.

This application should be called on a schedule from within the cluster.
